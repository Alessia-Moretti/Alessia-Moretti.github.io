Hi! I am a first year PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University, Milan. 

I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the University Milano-Bicocca and a Master's degree in Mathematics for Data Science from The University of Trento. During my Master's studies, I had the opportunity to participate in the Erasmus Traineeship program, which allowed me to complete my Master's thesis at the University of Edinburgh.

My recent work has focused on addressing the challenges of model-based clustering in high-dimensional settings, particularly through the lens of Bayesian nonparametric methods.

Feel free to contact me!
